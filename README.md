My CodeClan final project is about visit scotland

VisitScotland, formerly the Scottish Tourist Board, is a national tourism organisation for Scotland. It is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government, with offices arround Scotland.


VisitScotland's primary aim is to market Scotland as a tourism destination, which it does through advertising and promotion as well as encouraging press articles on Scotland and what it has to offer the business or consumer visitor.

The organisation also seeks to work with the tourism industry in Scotland to maintain standards in visitor attractions and accommodation provision.

The project looks at these questions below:

What kind of tourism activity generates the highest income for Scotland?

Which kind of activity generates the most visits to sites?

What type of locations receive the most visits? What kinds of locations do people spend the most in?

Is there a particular method of travel our visitors arrive by? Some of our locations are remote and not easily accessible by public transport, so this would be good information to have.

How have general tourism rates changed over time?

Is there any way to predict spending and visits for Visit Scotland?
